			"plainText": "Purple Hearts is a 2022 American romance film created for Netflix and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum. It is based upon the novel of the same name by Tess Wakefield. Its story follows an aspiring singer-songwriter named Cassie and a Marine named Luke, who both fall in love despite many obstacles. The film was released on July 29, 2022.\r\nThe rights for the film were originally owned by Alloy Entertainment, but Netflix bought the rights from them in August 2021. The production for the film started soon after that, with most of the scenes for the film recorded in locations around Riverside and San Diego, California.\r\nPlot\r\nCassie Salazar is a young woman living in a small broken-down apartment. Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 6 months ago, Cassie does not have enough to cover insulin. She can either pay for medication or pay rent, but not both. She works at a bar as a server where she also performs covers with her band, The Loyal. She first meets Luke Morrow when a group of newly recruited U.S Marines walks into the bar one night. In that group is Frankie, Cassie's childhood friend. They start to catch up when his friends start to make misogynistic jokes towards Cassie. She fires back at them before she walking away. Luke attempts to make amends which ultimately fails as the two have very opposite mindsets. Frankie warns Luke that Cassie has a no-dating-soldiers policy. A co-worker tells Cassie that one of the guys in the group told her that she should marry him because of the incredible health insurance. Cassie tests her glucose levels, which is revealed to be low. When she goes to the pharmacy, she, nor her mother, do not have enough cash to pay for it.\r\nLuke is also in a tough situation. Whilst running, something he does to clear his mind, an old friend who supported his drug addiction, Johnno, starts to chase him down. Luke still owes fifteen thousand dollars. Luke's own father also cut ties with him due to his poor life choices. When Cassie shows up at Frankie's house to ask him if he would marry her for the spousal healthcare benefits, Luke overhears the conversation. Frankie turns Cassie down because it's both fraud and of his plans to marry his girlfriend. Luke interrupts to explain that this would be cheating the government. However, he meets Cassie to speak about this further. They decide to wed before Luke deploys and pretend to be in love with constant email and video calls. After a year, they plan on filing for divorce when they both collect their required amount of money.\r\nAt their wedding, Frankie is the witness and gives Cassie the ring that he plans to marry his girlfriend with. He tells her to keep it safe. After, the fake newlyweds go to the bar with the same group of recruits. Cassie gets into an argument with the same marine from earlier over a toast about hunting down Arabs. Luke walks outside to cool down, where Cassie soon follows. They begin to argue by the window, when Luke reminds Cassie that everyone can see them. They hug and pretend to make amends. At night, they stay at a motel near base. Luke breaks down and admits that he is scared of both the fraudulent marriage and Iraq. Cassie comforts him and the two spend the night together.\r\nThe next morning Luke, Frankie and the rest of the squad are deployed to Iraq. Cassie and Luke keep to the plan and start sending emails and video calls to one another. Cassie tells Luke in a video chat that she has started writing her own songs. One of them, \"Come Back Home\", is written for Luke and the Marines. She performs it for them, which uplifts their spirits after a particularly rough day.\r\nCassie's song quickly starts to go viral, making her a rising star. One night, while performing \"Come Back Home\" with her band, she receives a call from a US Army Commander. He tells her that Luke severely wounded his leg and that he will be shipped back. Unsure of what to do, Cassie reaches out to Luke's brother. Unfortunately, Luke's brother shares the same name as his father, Jacob Morrow. She unwittingly reveals that she and Luke are married. At the hospital, Luke gets angry at Cassie for telling his father about them. He tells her that his father is a retired military police officer who’s tough and by-the-book when it comes to cracking down on crime. Luke believes his father wouldn't have a problem turning them in if he discovers what they did. After the argument, Cassie finds out that Frankie was killed in action in the accident Luke was in. At the funeral, Cassie meets Frankie's girlfriend. She gives the ring she promised to keep safe for Frankie.\r\nLuke, now wheelchair-bound, moves into Cassie's apartment after being discharged. They re-decorate the home to support their false marriage for his father Jacob, who picks him up twice a week to help him train. Cassie reads that a golden retriever is a good pet to support Luke's recovery and they take in Peaches. Luke is reluctant at first, but eventually accepts.\r\nThe Loyal begins to gain more attention and Luke has recovered well enough to walk with a cane. Luke learns that Johnno is still looking to collect his money when Cassie's mother informs them that someone has thrown a stone through her window.

			"html": "<p>Purple Hearts is a 2022 American romance film created for Netflix and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum. It is based upon the novel of the same name by Tess Wakefield. Its story follows an aspiring singer-songwriter named Cassie and a Marine named Luke, who both fall in love despite many obstacles. The film was released on July 29, 2022.</p><p>The rights for the film were originally owned by Alloy Entertainment, but Netflix bought the rights from them in August 2021. The production for the film started soon after that, with most of the scenes for the film recorded in locations around Riverside and San Diego, California.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Cassie Salazar is a young woman living in a small broken-down apartment. Diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 6 months ago, Cassie does not have enough to cover insulin. She can either pay for medication or pay rent, but not both. She works at a bar as a server where she also performs covers with her band, The Loyal. She first meets Luke Morrow when a group of newly recruited U.S Marines walks into the bar one night. In that group is Frankie, Cassie's childhood friend. They start to catch up when his friends start to make misogynistic jokes towards Cassie. She fires back at them before she walking away. Luke attempts to make amends which ultimately fails as the two have very opposite mindsets. Frankie warns Luke that Cassie has a no-dating-soldiers policy. A co-worker tells Cassie that one of the guys in the group told her that she should marry him because of the incredible health insurance. Cassie tests her glucose levels, which is revealed to be low. When she goes to the pharmacy, she, nor her mother, do not have enough cash to pay for it.</p><p>Luke is also in a tough situation. Whilst running, something he does to clear his mind, an old friend who supported his drug addiction, Johnno, starts to chase him down. Luke still owes fifteen thousand dollars. Luke's own father also cut ties with him due to his poor life choices. When Cassie shows up at Frankie's house to ask him if he would marry her for the spousal healthcare benefits, Luke overhears the conversation. Frankie turns Cassie down because it's both fraud and of his plans to marry his girlfriend. Luke interrupts to explain that this would be cheating the government. However, he meets Cassie to speak about this further. They decide to wed before Luke deploys and pretend to be in love with constant email and video calls. After a year, they plan on filing for divorce when they both collect their required amount of money.</p><p>At their wedding, Frankie is the witness and gives Cassie the ring that he plans to marry his girlfriend with. He tells her to keep it safe. After, the fake newlyweds go to the bar with the same group of recruits. Cassie gets into an argument with the same marine from earlier over a toast about hunting down Arabs. Luke walks outside to cool down, where Cassie soon follows. They begin to argue by the window, when Luke reminds Cassie that everyone can see them. They hug and pretend to make amends. At night, they stay at a motel near base. Luke breaks down and admits that he is scared of both the fraudulent marriage and Iraq. Cassie comforts him and the two spend the night together.</p><p>The next morning Luke, Frankie and the rest of the squad are deployed to Iraq. Cassie and Luke keep to the plan and start sending emails and video calls to one another. Cassie tells Luke in a video chat that she has started writing her own songs. One of them, \"Come Back Home\", is written for Luke and the Marines. She performs it for them, which uplifts their spirits after a particularly rough day.</p><p>Cassie's song quickly starts to go viral, making her a rising star. One night, while performing \"Come Back Home\" with her band, she receives a call from a US Army Commander. He tells her that Luke severely wounded his leg and that he will be shipped back. Unsure of what to do, Cassie reaches out to Luke's brother. Unfortunately, Luke's brother shares the same name as his father, Jacob Morrow. She unwittingly reveals that she and Luke are married. At the hospital, Luke gets angry at Cassie for telling his father about them. He tells her that his father is a retired military police officer who’s tough and by-the-book when it comes to cracking down on crime. Luke believes his father wouldn't have a problem turning them in if he discovers what they did. After the argument, Cassie finds out that Frankie was killed in action in the accident Luke was in. At the funeral, Cassie meets Frankie's girlfriend. She gives the ring she promised to keep safe for Frankie.</p><p>Luke, now wheelchair-bound, moves into Cassie's apartment after being discharged. They re-decorate the home to support their false marriage for his father Jacob, who picks him up twice a week to help him train. Cassie reads that a golden retriever is a good pet to support Luke's recovery and they take in Peaches. Luke is reluctant at first, but eventually accepts.</p><p>The Loyal begins to gain more attention and Luke has recovered well enough to walk with a cane. Luke learns that Johnno is still looking to collect his money when Cassie's mother informs them that someone has thrown a stone through her window. When investigating the home, Luke receives a threatening phone call about his debts. Later that night, Cassie's sugar level drops which sends her into shock. Luke helps her through the episode by holding her in his arms while feeding her some glucose gel. Cassie starts to feel better and the two share a kiss.</p><p>The following day Luke beats Johnno up for messing with his family. He gives him all the money that he owes and tells him to stay away.
